In 2006, Scott received his Black Belt alongside Rod Huus in the school&#x27;s first instance of testing two candidates for Black Belt at the same time.</p><p>Scott moved to the Twin Cities in 2006 to attend graduate studies at the University of Minnesota. Between 2006 and 2010, Scott taught a series of classes around the University of Minnesota campus, including at the St. Paul Gym. Scott was advanced by Dashi Gary Cecil to the rank of 2nd Level Black Belt (Yellow Sash) in 2009. In 2010, Scott was asked by Sifu Ryan Carden to serve as the assistant instructor at Wu Chi Fighting Arts.</p><p>Scott was advanced to 3rd Level Black Belt (Green Sash) in 2013 when he took over as interim head instructor of Wu Chi Fighting Arts after Sifu Ryan&#x27;s tragic and unexpected passing. Lao Shi Scott chose to leave Wu Chi Fighting Arts to found his own school, which was official chartered in 2015. In August of 2018, Scott was advanced to 4th Level Black Belt (Blue Sash), by Dashi Gary Cecil, in recognition of his accomplishments in teaching, as well as his work evolving the Phoenix and Xuan Wu forms.</p><p>Lao Shi Scott serves as an officer (Secretary) on the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association&#x27;s College of Black Belts, the governing body of the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association. He was instrumental in drafting the current Constitution and By-laws of the organization, which provides a framework for all member schools within the Wu Chi Kung Fu Association.</p><p>Lao Shi Scott has a wife (Amy), a daughter (Autumn), and a son (Quinn), all of whom he adores. Scott is an accomplished Computer Scientist, holding Bachelor&#x27;s Degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics and a Master&#x27;s Degree in Computer Science. During the winter months, Scott works as a hockey official for USAHockey Minnesota districts 6 and 8, as well as the Minnesota State High School League. In what little free time he has, Lao Shi Scott enjoys sailing.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section class="sidebar"><h2 class="section-title">Additional Information</h2><ul class="block-list"><li class="block-item"><a class="sidebar-block" href="/bogano/instructors"><div class="sidebar-block-media"><img src="/bogano/images/saam.png" class="sidebar-block-media-img" alt="Instructors &amp; Staff"/></div><div class="sidebar-block-body"><h2 class="sidebar-block-headline">Instructors &amp; Staff</h2><div class="sidebar-block-excerpt">Meet the instructors and staff members of the Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu</div></div></a></li><li class="block-item"><a class="sidebar-block" href="/bogano/curriculum"><div class="sidebar-block-media"><img src="/bogano/images/curriculum.png" class="sidebar-block-media-img" alt="Curriculum"/></div><div class="sidebar-block-body"><h2 class="sidebar-block-headline">Curriculum</h2><div class="sidebar-block-excerpt">An overview of what we teach and our methodology</div></div></a></li><li class="block-item"><a class="sidebar-block" href="/bogano/rules"><div class="sidebar-block-media"><img src="/bogano/images/whistle.png" class="sidebar-block-media-img" alt="Class Rules"/></div><div class="sidebar-block-body"><h2 class="sidebar-block-headline">Class Rules</h2><div class="sidebar-block-excerpt">A list of rules to follow while participating at the Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu</div></div></a></li><li class="block-item"><a class="sidebar-block" href="/bogano/ranks"><div class="sidebar-block-media"><img src="/bogano/images/belts-small.png" class="sidebar-block-media-img" alt="Belt Ranks"/></div><div class="sidebar-block-body"><h2 class="sidebar-block-headline">Belt Ranks</h2><div class="sidebar-block-excerpt">Take a look at our belt rankings and the symbolism behind them</div></div></a></li><li class="block-item"><a class="sidebar-block" href="/bogano/pricing"><div class="sidebar-block-media"><img src="/bogano/images/coins-small.png" class="sidebar-block-media-img" alt="Pricing"/></div><div class="sidebar-block-body"><h2 class="sidebar-block-headline">Pricing</h2><div class="sidebar-block-excerpt">View our student pricing schedule for information on our class and equipment costs</div></div></a></li></ul></section></section></div><footer class="footer" role="sitemap"><div class="layout"><div class="layout-oneline"><div class="logo-and-copyright-container"><a class="logo-footer-link" href="/bogano"><div class="logo-container"><div class="inline-logo-container"><img class="logo" src="/bogano/images/logo-monochrome.svg" alt="Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu"/></div><div class="inline-textmark-container"><h3 class="textmark alternate">Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu</h3></div></div></a><div class="copyright"><p>Â© Copyright 2023 Sinking Moon School of Kung Fu.
